## Description
An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

### Claim your planet before its gone!
Claiming a planet lets you give it a unique and official sounding name!

Beware, once its named it cannot be changed, edited or removed!

This app operates on an anonymous first come, first served basis. Go to the deployment, find an unclaimed planet, claim and make it yours!
